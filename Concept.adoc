Concept
=======

Folders and Files which should be backed up are specified in a _json_
configuration file. Every entry has a name. The name is used as wrapping
folder.  When the backup process is started all the entries are parsed and then
a robocopy process is started for every entry. After the backups have finished
a summary with possible errors is shown.

== Configuration file
[source, json]
----
[
    {
        "folder": "C:/Temp/destination",
        "elements": [
            {
                "name": "A",
                "path": "C:/Temp/source/a.txt",
                "excludes": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
----

This creates a backup of `a.txt` in `C:/Temp/source` and saves it in
`C:/Temp/destination/A/a.txt`.
