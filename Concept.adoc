Concept
=======

Folders and Files which should be backed up are specified in a _json_
configuration file. Every entry has a name. The name is used as wrapping folder
for single files and ignored for backup folders (still can be used as
documentation). When the backup process is started all the entries are
parsed and then a robocopy process is started for every entry. After the
backups have finished a summary with possible errors is shown.
